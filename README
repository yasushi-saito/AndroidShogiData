This is a skeleton Android application that just installs a few, large
files needed by AndroidShogi. It is split from AndroidShogi itself
because

(1) these files are really large (43MB compressed)
(2) their contents rarely change

The android shogi program is available at the Android market:

  https://market.android.com/details?id=com.ysaito.shogi

Its source code is available at:

  https://github.com/yasushi-saito/AndroidShogi
